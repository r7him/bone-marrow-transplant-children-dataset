# bone-marrow-transplant-children-dataset
The dataset we will be working on is the Bone marrow transplant: children dataset. This type of this dataset is multivariate and it has 187 instances where the number of attributes is 39. The associated tasks with this dataset are classification and regression. It also contains some missing values. The data set includes children patients with a variety of hematologic disorders who received allogeneic unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation without any manipulation. (Sikora, 21) We will perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in this dataset. To tell a story with this dataset we need to identify all aspects of this dataset. As we already know this dataset is multi-variant, so we have to plot data taking two or multiple variables and show them accordingly. I worked on google colab to analyze the dataset. From the data dictionary, we already had this idea about the columns and other important factors. In colab, I imported all necessary libraries which I will need to plot my dataset.
